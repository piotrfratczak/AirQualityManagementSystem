The method we use is agile iterative, which we experienced in our class.
%
At first, we takled about the structure of our project and got a UML diagram to split the whole project into many different part.
%
So we can focus on just one part every time and finished our project.
%
We got five classes, Attribute, AirSample, AirSystem, Sensor.
%
And we thought functions that interacts with user should be put in AirSystem class and we also did this.
%
We listed every class in post it seperately and set priority for them.
% 
First, we created classes and finished the whole structure of this project. 
%
After that, we finished every function in this project.
%
This was our first sprint. In oue second sprint, we talked about the structure and found some better we to achieve our goal.
%
Also we tried our best to make code consice, which is always my habbit.
%
In third sprint, I added test part for the whole peoject.
%
And we talked about the result we get from this sprint.
%
There were still some conrer situation we did not think about.
%
So we fixed these bugs in fourth sprint.
%
This is what our procedure during the whole project.
